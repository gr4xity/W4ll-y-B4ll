# Requirements
## Run-Time
* *Formera* TrueType font: [https://github.com/noirblancrouge/Formera](https://github.com/noirblancrouge/Formera/tree/master/fonts/ttf)
## Build
* *Red Toolchain*: [https://www.red-lang.org](https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html)
* *graphecs* engine: https://github.com/gr4xity/graphecs (private)

# Issues
The Red toolchain compiles directly to native code with no external dependencies. Unfamiliarity may freak out your anti-virus protection with false positives. [See more information here](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BNOTE%5D-Anti-virus-false-positives).
